# Gina's Personal Bio Site

As a student at Nashville Software School, I was tasked with creating a personal bio site to be updated with new technologies as new milestones were reached. The site contains About, Blog, Resume, and Portfolio sections. Below are the milestones required for the site: 

1. Professional History Page and Contact Page (HTML)
2. Adding Interactive Navigation (CSS)
3. Adding A Blog Page (CSS - Flexbox)
4. Using JS to write to the DOM (JS - loops)
5. Using JSON/XHR to write your blog articles to the DOM (JS - XHR)
6. Bootstrapping Your Personal Bio Site (Bootstrap)
7. ES6-ify Your Entire Personal Site (ES6)
8. Add Jquery 
9. Add SASS 
10. Add Firebase
